(5) Information problem that we try to solve 

The information problem we tried to solve was to fix the way small buisnesses pay their employees. Small business owners have to hand write and input data into spreadsheets that track and calculate employee pay per week. This is time consuming and at times can be unreliable. There can also be trust issues that arise with the manager manually keeping track of payments and paying out the employees. Most small businessess have no real point-of-sales systems, and especially one that can deal with commissions.

(6) Strategies/solutions to solve the problem 

The solution for this problem that we can up with was to create a point-of-sales application that can be accessed and used on a computer.
