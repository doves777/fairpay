(5) the information problem that you try to solve 

The information problem we tried to solve was to fix the way small buisnesses pay their employees. Small business owners have to hand write and input data into spreadsheets that track and calculate employee pay per week. This is time consuming and at times can be unreliable. Since most small business's have no real poit-of-sales systems, there can be trust issues between emplyees and the manager.
